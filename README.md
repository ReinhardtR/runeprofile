RuneProfile aims to be the best place to share your Old School RuneScape achievements with others.

The official Hiscores only shows a subset of your achievements and can be tough to navigate.

RuneProfile tries to display all of your important achievements and in a familiar UI.
to create a familiar user experience.

The plugin is needed to upload your account data to RuneProfile, which will be displayed on the RuneProfile.com website.

You can read more about how to use RuneProfile here: [runeprofile.com/info/guide](https://runeprofile.com).

## Project Structure

This project is a monorepo managed using Turborepo.

-   `apps/api`: Backend application serving the API.
-   `apps/web`: Frontend application for the website.
-   `packages/runescape`: Shared package for RuneScape related data and utilities.
-   `scripts`: Various utility scripts for development.

## Development

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version specified in root package.json)
-   [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (version specified in root package.json)

### Installation

Run the setup script
```bash
pnpm dev:setup
```

Run the apps.
```bash
pnpm dev
```

Since the project is hosted with Cloudflare, this command utilizes `wrangler` and `miniflare` to simulate the Cloudflare environment locally.

The frontend will start at `localhost:3001` and the backend at `localhost:8787`.

### Adding new RuneScape data

The project has internal definitions of RuneScape data that is used to validate data on the backend and display it on the frontend. These definitions need to be updated when new content is released to the game. These definitions can be found in `packages/runescape` and can be easily updated by anyone who wants to contribute.

When new items are added, the `apps/web/assets/item-icons.json` file needs to be updated. The file is generated by running the `scripts/generate-icons.ts` script.

When new entries are added to the hiscores, the `apps/web/assets/hiscore-icons.json` file needs to be updated. This file is generated by running the plugin (in developer mode), and using the `DEV: Hiscore Icons` button in the RuneProfile plugin panel, to generate the file (it will be in the root of the plugin project).
