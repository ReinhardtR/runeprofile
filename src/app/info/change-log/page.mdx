<Title title="Updated Wilderness Bosses" date="2023-01-26" />

The Wilderness Boss Rework changed the names of the Collection Log pages of the wilderness bosses (Callisto, Venenatis and Vet'ion). This required some manual work on the stored profile data.

The data from the old pages should now be moved to the new ones. This includes kill counts and the kill counts which the items were obtained at. The data should be moved automatically.

If you dont see the page on your profile, try opening the page in-game and then updating your profile. If there is any issues you can send feedback or contact me on Discord, found at the bottom of the site.
